##  About the Project

This repo contains the starter code and scaffolding for **Task 1** of the JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Program on Forage. It’s designed to give hands-on experience in setting up a development environment, handling real-time data, and writing clean, testable code. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

##  What's Inside

| File / Component     | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `server3.py`          | Simulates the stock data feed server. |
| `client3.py`          | The script where you'll process feed data—a key file to fix and extend. |
| `client_test.py`      | Unit tests for validating your `client3.py` logic. |
| `test.csv`            | Sample dataset for validating your data parsing. |
| `requirements.txt`    | Lists dependencies needed to run your code. |

These align with the typical task requirements: interface with data feeds, process real-time stock information, run unit tests, and deliver a clean implementation. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
